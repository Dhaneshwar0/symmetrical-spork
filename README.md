# Rapido-clone (Ride-hailing) — Starter Plan & Prototype

Overview
- This repository is a starting point for building a Rapido-like ride-hailing app (rider + driver).
- It contains an MVP plan, recommended tech stack, API and DB sketches, and two minimal demo files:
  - server/index.js — a tiny Express + Socket.IO backend prototype
  - mobile/App.js — an Expo React Native app that displays a map and streams location to the server

MVP feature list (priority)
1. User sign up / login (Rider + Driver)
2. Rider: request ride, see ETA, fare estimate
3. Driver: receive ride requests, accept/decline
4. Real-time location updates (driver <-> rider) using WebSockets
5. Basic payments integration (Stripe/Razorpay / local provider)
6. Ride history, ratings
7. Notifications (push)

Recommended tech stack
- Mobile: React Native (Expo) + TypeScript (or plain JS for prototype)
- Backend: Node.js + Express + TypeScript (or JS for prototype), Socket.IO for realtime
- DB: PostgreSQL for transactional data, Redis for in-memory state / matchmaking
- Maps: Google Maps Platform or Mapbox (Directions API for routing/fare distance)
- Auth: JWT / Firebase Auth
- Payments: Stripe / Razorpay (depending on country)
- Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
- Deployment: Docker -> AWS/GCP/Azure; consider autoscaling for realtime traffic

Architecture (high level)
- Mobile apps (Rider/Driver) <-> Backend REST APIs (auth, rides, payments)
- Realtime via Socket.IO for location & ride events
- Postgres for persistent data, Redis for ephemeral data (available drivers, matching)
- External services: Maps/Directions API, Payment provider, FCM

API sketches (MVP)
- POST /api/auth/signup (email/phone, password, role: rider|driver)
- POST /api/auth/login -> returns JWT
- GET /api/estimate?from=lat,lng&to=lat,lng -> fare estimate, distance, duration
- POST /api/rides/request { rider_id, from, to } -> creates ride request
- POST /api/rides/:id/cancel
- GET /api/rides/:id -> ride status
- POST /api/rides/:id/complete -> mark complete (trigger payment)
- WebSocket events:
  - driver:location { driverId, lat, lng }
  - rider:location { riderId, lat, lng }
  - ride:request { rideId, rider, from, to } (server->nearby drivers)
  - ride:accepted { rideId, driverId } (driver->server->rider)
  - ride:update { rideId, status }

Database sketch (tables)
- users (id, name, phone, email, role[rider|driver], password_hash, created_at)
- drivers (id, user_id, vehicle_id, status[available|on_trip|offline], rating)
- vehicles (id, driver_id, model, plate, capacity)
- rides (id, rider_id, driver_id, from_lat, from_lng, to_lat, to_lng, fare, status, started_at, ended_at)
- locations (id, entity_type[rider|driver], entity_id, lat, lng, updated_at)
- payments (id, ride_id, amount, status, provider_payment_id)

Estimated timeline (single small team — 1 backend, 1 mobile, 1 infra)
- Week 1: Design, APIs, DB schema, basic backend skeleton, auth
- Week 2: Mobile app skeleton, map + location sharing, backend realtime
- Week 3: Matching logic + driver workflow + push notifications
- Week 4: Payments integration + ratings + ride history; test & bugfix
- Month 2+: Scale, monitoring, security, QA, app store submission

Local quickstart (prototype)
- Backend: run Node server, listens on port 3000 and Socket.IO
- Mobile: run Expo, connect socket to backend (adjust IP/URL)

Notes about production
- Use HTTPS, secure tokens, rate limits
- Protect driver location data, comply with local privacy rules
- Use geohashing or spatial indexes for efficient nearby-driver queries
- Add monitoring (Sentry), logging, and automatic scaling for realtime servers

Contact / next steps
- Tell me your priority: MVP only, full product, or just a prototype. Also tell me preferred payment provider and target country.
- I can (1) create a GitHub repo with these files, (2) expand the backend with full auth and matching, (3) add CI/CD and deployment manifests.
